# sosafe

an elegant way to show developers why they should read source code when they are using someone else's code.

  - only works at OSX.

## why?

**You can almost hide anything at an npm package.** I just want to create demo for mac developers.

### usage

```sh
$ sudo npm install sosafe -global
$ sosafe
```

**fell free to create win or linux ports, i'll gladly accept it.**
